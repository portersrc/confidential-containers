# Confidential Containers

## Welcome to confidential-containers

Confidential Containers is an open source community working to leverage 
[Trusted Execution Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment) 
to protect containers and data and to deliver cloud native 
confidential computing.

**We have a new release every 6 weeks!**
See [Release Notes](./releases/index.rst) or [Quickstart Guide](./docs/quickstart.md)

Our key considerations are:
- Allow cloud native application owners to enforce application security requirements
- Transparent deployment of unmodified containers
- Support for multiple TEE and hardware platforms
- A trust model which separates Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) from guest applications
- Least privilege principles for the Kubernetes cluster administration capabilities which impact 
delivering Confidential Computing for guest applications or data inside the TEE

### Get started quickly... 
- [Kubernetes Operator for Confidential
  Computing](https://github.com/confidential-containers/confidential-containers-operator) : An
  operator to deploy confidential containers runtime (and required configs) on a Kubernetes cluster
